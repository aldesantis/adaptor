Adaptor makes it easy to implement the [Adapter pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adapter_pattern) in Ruby.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'adaptor'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install adaptor

## Usage

You can use the library in single-adaptor mode:

```ruby
module Pagination
  include Adaptor::Loader
  register WillPaginate, Kaminari
end

module Pagination
  class Kaminari
    include Adaptor
        
    def self.supports?(object)
      # return whether this adaptor supports the object
    end
  end
  
  class WillPaginate 
    include Adaptor
    
    def self.supports?(object)
      # return whether this adaptor supports the object
    end
  end
end

adaptor = Pagination.load_adaptor(object)
adaptor.some_method
```

Or, if it suits your use-case, you can use it in multiple-adaptor mode:

```ruby
module NotificationProcessor
  class Email
    include Adaptor
        
    def self.supports?(notification)
      notification.user.email.present?
    end
    
    def initialize(notification)
      @notification = notification
    end
    
    def deliver
      # ...
    end
  end
  
  class Sms 
    include Adaptor
    
    def self.supports?(notification)
      notification.user.phone.present?
    end
    
    def initialize(notification)
      @notification = notification
    end
    
    def deliver
      # ...
    end
  end
end

module MultipleAdaptorLoader
  include Adaptor::Loader
  register Email, Sms
end

NotificationProcessor.load_adaptors(notifications).each(&:deliver)
```

Note that `#load_adaptor` will return `nil` when it cannot find any adaptors, while `#load_adaptors`
will return an empty array. If you prefer, you can also use `#load_adaptor!` and `#load_adaptors!` 
respectively to raise an `Adaptor::NoAdaptorError` when no adaptor can be found.
